TEMPNET Action aims at providing a deep understanding on how phenological changes in interacting plant and animals affect their dynamics over seasonal and long-term timespans. Given the current ecological crisis in which we are immersed, unveiling the complexity of ecological interactions is fundamental for biodiversity conservation. For this, we have combined state-of-the-art mathematical advances in multilayer network analysis, sound ecological theory, and field observations.

TEMPNET has been funded by a Marie S. Curie Individual Fellowship by the European Research Council (798269 — TEMPNET — H2020-MSCA-IF-2017)
